This is our "Who pays the bill" [german: Wer Zahlt EigenTlich => WZET] tool.

Visuals and code are both very crude, since I just hacked it with little effort put into it.

To get a running instance:

1. Create `inc/config.php` (you can copy and adapt `inc/config.dist.php`).
2. Copy `inc/db/empty.sqlite` to your specified DB.
3. Register a user and set his flag to _1_ [=Admin] in the database.
4. (optional) add phpsqliteadmin to sqladmin.php

General todo (not in any order):

1.  Prevent JS injection via Name/Login (display is not filtered atm); fix german special chars (Umlaute) while at that.
2.  setup.php?
3.  Localization
4.  A design
6.  Function: Start event so people can RSVP and add their +X
7.  Function: Rollback
8.  Function: Add another bill (by someone else) - DB should be able to reflect this, but the code does not
9.  DB names should be english, not german
10. display more details in the log

DB layout is not quite 100% ERM, but I believe the way I did it now is a bit more versatile.
I.e. the Users.Konto value could be computed on the fly, but that way it can be bootstrapped with values != 0.
